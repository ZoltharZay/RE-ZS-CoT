Now, the 3-D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10.\nAs anyone who has seen the movie knows, the Titanic struck an iceberg  and sank on its first _ in 1912, killing 1,517 people. A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years.

Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities.\nAn official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  .\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.\nPoor air has done harm to people's health.

A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems.\nTo respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action.\nBeijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions   should be banned and factories should be closely watched.\nThree students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \"We hope more people will join us to protect our environment.

{"article": "Fred Astaire was born in Nebraska in 1899. Fred and his sister, Adele, learned to dance when they were very young. Their mother took them to New York to study dance. They performed in their first professional show when Fred was ten years old and Adele was twelve. Later, as teenagers, the two danced in many shows throughout the United States. Their first big success was on Broadway in 1917.\nThe Astaires -- as they were known --- became Broadway stars. However, in 1932, Adele Astaire married a British man, and stopped performing. But Fred did not give up his dream. He would go on alone, in the movies.\nFred said, \"Dancing is a sweaty job. You cannot just sit down and do it. You have to get up on your feet. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable. I always try to get to know my dance so well that I do not have to think.\"\nIn 1949, Fred Astaire won a special award for his film work from America's Motion Picture Academy. He also won awards from the television industry for a number of his television programs.[:ZXXK]\nFred stopped dancing in 1970. He was more than seventy years old at the time. He said a dancer could not continue dancing forever. He said he did not want to disappoint  anyone, even himself. He danced again in public only once after that. It was with another great male dancer, Gene Kelly, in the movie \"That's Entertainment, Part Two\".\nFred Astaire and his first wife, Phyllis, had three children. Phyllis died in 1954. Twenty-five years later, Fred married race horse rider Robyn Smith. Fred Astaire died on June 22, 1987. He was eighty-eight years old. He was called the greatest dancer in the world. His dancing was called perfect. And moviegoers everywhere will remember him as a great performer whose work will live forever in his films.", "question": "When did the Astaires become Broadway stars?", "options": ["In 1899.", "In 1917.", "In 1932.", "In 1949."], "answer": "B", "id": "middle6471.txt-0"}

The researchers say a single charge can power a 50-watt Led light for two hours - enough time for local villagers to get their evening work done.\nThe university gave ten Plant Lamps to the villagers of Nuevo Saposoa in October 2015.

Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do. Before it's too late, here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster:\nEducate: It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters. This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly.\nPrepare: Always be prepared, that is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed.\nPlan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read.

{"article": "Have you ever stayed in a hotel? Most Chinese hotels often provide guests with things like disposable  toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and slippers. Many guests like the idea because they don't have to bring their own. But ,if you travel to Beijing , remember to bring your own things. Starting from June, some hotels in Beijing will no longer provide guests with these disposable things. They want to ask people to use less disposable things.\nMany disposable things are made of plastic. People throw them away after only using them once. It is a waste of natural resources  and is very bad for the environment. Do you know, one Chinese makes as much as 400kg of waste a year! Most of that waste comes from disposable things. In Beijing, people throw away about 19,000 tons of plastic bags and1,320 tons of plastic lunch bowls every year! Plastic can take between 100 and 400 years to break down.

He did that for three months.\nLater, he heard that a newspaper was looking for a network technician ,so he asked for it.

Especially in large cities, stores may be open 24 hours a day.\nServings in restaurants are often large, too large for many people. If you can't finish your meal but would like to have the food later, ask your waiter or waitress for a--' doggie bag\". It may have a picture of a dog on it, but everybody knows you're taking the food for yourself.\nSupper and dinner are both words for the evening meal. Some people have \" Sunday dinner\". This is an especially big noon meal.\nTips are not usually added to the check. They are not included in the price of the meal, either. A tip of about 15% is expected and you should leave it on the table when you leave. In some restaurants, a check is brought on a plate and you put your money there. Then the waiter or waitress brings you your change.\n,.", "question": "What does the passage mainly want to tell us ?", "options": ["Rules for US bars and restaurants.", "Ways of sitting with people you don't know.", "Doggie bags for keeping food for yourselves .", "Dinner customs in the US restaurants."], "answer": "D", "id": "middle3775.txt-4"}

{"article": "When a cake is brought to the table at a birthday party, it is usually decorated with candles. It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks; it has taken on different meanings through the years. Today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true.\nIn order to please Artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays. A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived.\nThe tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers  to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten.\nTraditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. Generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday.\nToday's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers.

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks; it has taken on different meanings through the years. Today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true.\nIn order to please Artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays. A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived.\nThe tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers  to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten.\nTraditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. Generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday.\nToday's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers. One or two candles in the shape of numbers are sometimes used instead of lots of candles; for example, a four-shaped and a zero-shaped candle would represent 40.", "question": "What is the tradition of lighting candles for birthdays like in Europe?", "options": ["The candles were always kept burning all day on a person's birthday.", "The blowing out of candles represented one's prayers to the god.", "Some cultures believe it is right to blow out the candles before the evening meal.", "The Europeans sometimes keep burning the candles all day just as a celebration.

It ensures more privacy  and it helps you avoid receiving spam  from sellers. But some users were quick to see the business opportunities of \"Moments\" and have turned it into a mini-marketplace. They are recommending   products to their friends and offering to either sell the products directly or act as a middleman  for the purchases.\nOne woman told the Shanxi Evening News that she makes money as a middleman, or purchasing agent. She added a few sellers of fake  handbags to her friends list and posts pictures of the handbags. When a friend is interested in buying a bag, they pay her the money and she has the sellers send the goods. \"There are zero costs for storage and logistics ,\" she says, \"and I make money simply from the price difference.\" It's a nice business model, but the woman didn't seem to know that she was doing something against the law by selling fakes to her friends.\nAnother woman was connected with even more dishonest business. She sold facial masks  that had \"magical\" effects to make women's skin beautiful. Unluckily, the masks caused the faces of some of her \"friends\" to break out in red spots and pimples , and when they asked for _ , the woman magically disappeared.\nSocial media is easier to stay connected with friends and to share your experiences with them. And it's OK to \"recommend\" something or try to make money from your friends. Turning your friends into customers is a sure way to lose those friends.", "question": "According to the passage, what will happen if the users of the \"Moments\" function on WeChat sell products in a dishonest way to their friends?", "options": ["They'll make more friends.", "The friendship between them and their friends will come to an end.", "They will never use the \"Moments\" function on WeChat.", "They will lose everything."], "answer": "B", "id": "middle6118.txt-1"}

You speak in a voice so low that other people can hear you. Try to speak aloud enough so that people can hear you clearly. The high voice can help you become more confident.\nPlay sports  Physical exercise makes you tired but completely relaxed. When you are athletic, you will be full of confidence.\nEncourage yourself Write down a list of things you did during the day and see how many things you have done well. Did you finish your homework? Did you tell a joke that made everybody laugh? Give yourself praise for the good things you've done.\nGet rid of  fear Fear comes along with failure  . But it's easy to get over if you know that failure is a part of your life. Don't hide your head just because you said something foolish last time. Try to start again and believe you can do better.\nPick up a hobby   If you like singing, singing as much as you can. In some ways, a hobby can make you outstanding. And it will make you happy and confident.", "question": "The best title for the passage is  _  .", "options": ["Encourage yourself", "How to be more confident", "Pick up a hobby", "Get rid of fear"], "answer": "B", "id": "middle6322.txt-4"}
{"article": "My favourite great book is The adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention.\nPost-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages.\nAround that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed.

Waste a drop of water a day and you lose a bucket  a year. How can we use water in a smart way? Here are some tips for you to save water in your daily life:\n1. Put plastic bottles of water in your toilet to cut down the water waste when you flush   your toilet.\n2. Don't keep the water running while you're brushing your teeth or washing your face and hands.\n3. Use low-flow  shower heads .\n4. Use a bucket to collect shower water while you wait for it to warm up.\n5. Make your shower time shorter.\n6.

Add money for clothes, travel, and other personal expenses, and the cost of one year at a university can be $20, 000 to $30,000 or more.\nStudents need to spend their money carefully. At most universities, advisors can give students advice on how to budget  their money. They suggest this: at the start of a school term, write down your income; for example, money you will get from your family or a part-time job. Then, list all of your expenses. Put your expenses into two groups: those that change (food, phone, books, travel), and those that will stay the same (tuition, room and board). Add together all of your expenses.
